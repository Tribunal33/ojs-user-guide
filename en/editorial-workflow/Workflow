## <a name="Workflow#submission"></a>Submission Stage

a. Introduction
b. [Editorial Actions](submission#editorial-actions)

During the Submission stage, the editor checks the submission files to decide whether it should begin the peer review process.

The editor can assign a sub-editor to assist by using the **Participants** panel or open up a discussion with the author to answer any questions or concerns in the **Pre-Review Discussions** panel.

### <a name="editorial-actions"></a>Editorial Actions

#### Send to Review

Send the submission on to the [Review stage](review), where it will be reviewed by peer reviewers.

#### Send to Copyediting

Send the submission forward to the [Copyediting stage](copyediting) if you'd like to skip the peer review process completely.

#### Decline Submission

Remove the submission from consideration and archive it.

## <a name="Workflow#review"></a>Review Stages

a. [Orientation](review#orientation)
b. [Editorial Actions](review#editorial-actions)

During the Review stage, the editor assigns reviewers to the submission.

Once the reviewers have submitted their reviews and recommendations, the editor is responsible for making an editorial decision, which will determine whether the submission is ready for the Copyediting stage or requires further revisions.

By default, the review stages begin in *Round 1* of reviews. Further rounds may be initiated if the editor requests major changes that must go through another round of review. For more detailed information, see [Learning OJS 3: Review](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#review).

### <a name="orientation"></a>Orientation

Each review round consists of sections for managing review files and reviewers, along with the discussions and participants section that appear on every stage.

#### <a name="review-files"></a>Review Files
All the files selected by the editor for review. These files will be visible to reviewers unless restricted when assigning the reviewer.

#### <a name="reviewers"></a>Reviewers
Editors can add reviewers, assign due dates, and monitor the status and recommendations of the reviews. When a review has been completed, the editor can view and confirm the review to acknowledge that they've read it.

#### <a name="revisions"></a>Revisions
Revised files uploaded by the author. During the review process, the editor may request revisions from the author. Once uploaded, they appear here and will be available to send to the Copyediting stage once they've passed review.

#### <a name="discussions"></a>Review Discussions
Editors and sub-editors can initiate private conversations among themselves or with reviewers or authors. Authors cannot initiate discussions or communicate directly with reviewers.

The review discussions are not particular to any one round and will carry over to subsequent rounds if a new review round is initiated.

#### <a name="participants"></a>Participants
Editors and sub-editors can add additional users to this stage to assist them in managing the review process. This is commonly used by an editor who wants a sub-editor to handle the day-to-day communications with reviewers. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow#participants).

### <a name="editorial-actions"></a>Editorial Actions
The editor can make one of several editorial actions during each round of the review stage. Each of these decisions automatically notifies the author by email.

#### <a name="request-revisions"></a>Request Revisions
The editor can request revisions from the author without opening a new review round. This is common when minor revisions are required which the editor can approve without resubmitting for  review.

#### <a name="new-review"></a>Resubmit for Review
The editor can request revisions from the author that will need to go through another round of review. Once revisions are received, a new review round will need to be created at the top of the review stage.

#### <a name="copyediting"></a>Send to Copyediting
The editor can initiate the [Copyediting stage](copyediting) once it has passed the required review stage.

#### <a name="decline"></a>Decline Submission
The editor can decline the submission if it does not pass review. The submission will be removed from the editorial workflow and sent to the Archives.

## <a name="Workflow#copyediting"></a>Copyediting

a. [Orientation](copyediting#orientation)
b. [Editorial Actions](copyediting#editorial-actions)

During the Copyediting stage, the editor assigns a copyeditor to edit the submission files.

The copyeditor, who is often a professional, will align the writing style with your editorial guidelines, improve the quality and clarity of the writing, fix any grammar, and get the submission ready for conversion to a [publication format](production).

This is the last stage before you generate publication-ready formats such as PDFs and ePubs. If you do not have the resources to hire a professional copyeditor, use this stage to take a close look at the material, check any facts, correct any errors, and communicate with the author to clarify any points of confusion.

Add copyeditors from the [participants panel](../editorial-workflow#participants).
For more detailed information, see [Learning OJS 3: Copyediting](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#copyediting).

### <a name="orientation"></a>Orientation

The Copyediting stage provides three panels for managing the copyediting process.

#### <a name="draft-files"></a>Draft Files

All files selected by the editor for copyediting. These are typically files that have been revised as a result of the review process.

#### <a name="copyediting-discussions"></a>Copyediting Discussions

Editors and copyeditors can use this panel to initiate discussions with the author(s) or communicate among themselves. This can be used to clarify points of confusion, request further information from the author, or request approval for any changes.

#### <a name="copyedited"></a>Copyedited

Copyeditors can upload final edited files to this panel. These should be completed files that are ready to be [sent to production](copyediting#editorial-actions).

*Editors can upload files here, too.*

#### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add copyeditors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow#participants).

### <a name="editorial-actions"></a>Editorial Actions

There's only one editorial decision available to editors at this stage. If you decide to decline a submission at this late stage, you can do so by going back to a previous stage.

#### <a name="production"></a>Send to Production

The editor can send the submission to the [Production stage](production) when final copyedited files are ready. Any files in the [Copyedited](copyediting#copyedited) panel will automatically be forwarded unless the editor chooses not to send them.

## <a name="Workflow#production"></a>Production

a. [Orientation](production#orientation)
b. [Publishing the Submission](production#publish)

During the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants who will help prepare the final publication files, known as galleys. For more detailed information, see [Learning OJS 3: Production](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#production).

### <a name="orientation"></a>Orientation

The Production stage provides two panels to create files ready for publication.

#### <a name="production-ready"></a>Production Ready Files

All files selected by the editor for production will appear here. These typically include files that have been prepared during the [Copyediting stage](copyediting). Production assistants will use these files to generate the final publication formats.

#### <a name="production-discussions"></a>Production Discussions

Editors and production assistants can use this panel to initiate conversations if there are any details that need to be clarified before the final publication files can be created.

#### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add production assistants or layout editors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow#participants).

## <a name="publish"></a>Publishing the Submission

Editors and production assistants can create galley files for publication. These typically represent separate publication formats, such as PDF and HTML.

Once the production-ready files have been transformed into a galley file ready for publication, Editors can move from the Workflow panel to the Publication tab by using the Schedule for Publication button. The galley file will then be uploaded in the Publication tab.
